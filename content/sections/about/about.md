I'm an experienced <u>Game Developer</u> with 6 years of experience in the <u>Game Industry</u>. I currently reside in the sunny concrete jungle of Manila. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ðŸŒž

I primarily use the <u>Unity Game Engine</u> in my day-to-day work and for hobby projects. I do some backend work too since I've mainly worked on live service mobile games. I've used languages like <u>Go</u> when working with <u>Nakama Game Servers </u>, and <u>Javascript</u> for <u>Microsoft PlayFab</u>. I have the servers deployed in a neat little container using <u>Docker</u> and <u>AWS</u>. I also do a bit of web development using <u>Node</u> and <u>Vue</u>. 

If I'm not writing code, I'm either playing video games like Doom: Eternal and STALKER: Anomaly GAMMA or playing Airsoft and tinkering with my equipment.

I'm always open to try new technologies to develop unforgettable gaming experiences. If you'd like to work together, please feel free to hit me up!
