This project is also the first time I used Unity's new Addressables system. \n \n I used it to develop and maintain an audio system that dynamically loads sound assets to prevent memory leaks. I developed tools that serialize excel data sheets into in-engine data structures. Lastly, I developed sound mixing and voice localization tools for other Developers and Designers for ease of integration in the Unity Game Engine.",
